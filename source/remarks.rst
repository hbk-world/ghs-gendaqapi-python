Remarks
========

* It is not possible to move/copy recordings from the local mainframe storage to a PC storage location via the GEN DAQ API. If you want to do this you have to enable the remote access to the internal disk. This can be done using Perception via the Mainframe Settings dialog. In this help file you can find how to do this. Look for GEN DAQ Remote Access item.
* The GEN DAQ API is supported by the following mainframes: GEN3i, GEN3t, GEN7i, GEN7tA, GEN7i and GEN2tB
* Recordings can’t be made via the GEN DAQ API on the GEN3i, GEN7i and GEN7i as these mainframes don’t have local storage.
* FieldBus alike data streaming is only supported using tethered mainframes and does not function when used on integrated mainframes
